# Blackjack Game in Lua
A classic Blackjack game implemented in Lua programming language. The game features a simple user interface and basic game mechanics, allowing players to experience the thrill of the popular casino game from the comfort of their own device.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
I run my game on VSCode with the application, LOVE2D. You can download the latest version of LOVE2D from the officia lhttps://love2d.org/ page. Please be sure to have the IDE (in this case VSCode) and LOVE2D installed before use.

## Installing
To install the game, simply clone or download the repository to your local machine.

**Copy code:** git clone https://github.com/teddycormier/blackjack_lua.git <br><br>
After downloading the repository, open a new project in VSCode, navigate to the main window (has to be the main window, otherwise it wont run), use command + L on MacOS and Alt + L on Windows to run the game through the LOVE2D interface.

## Gameplay
The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by having a hand value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible, without exceeding it. The game starts with the player being dealt two cards, and the dealer being dealt one card face up and one card face down. The player can choose to hit (take another card) or stand (keep their current hand). If the player exceeds a hand value of 21, they lose the game.

## Built With
Lua programming language and LOVE2D
